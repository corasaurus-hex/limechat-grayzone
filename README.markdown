GrayZone
========

Originally forked from someone, I forget who. It's plain, it's bland, it's readable. I love it.

To Install
==========

Note: LimeChat doesn't like symlinking of theme files into the theme directory, so we're just going to download them directly.

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/LimeChat/Themes
    curl -O http://github.com/corasaurus-hex/limechat-grayzone/raw/master/GrayZone.css
    curl -O http://github.com/corasaurus-hex/limechat-grayzone/raw/master/GrayZone.yaml
